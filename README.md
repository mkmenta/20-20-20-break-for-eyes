# 20-20-20 rule following Apple script reminder
This Apple Script will launch a dialog each 20 minutes reminding to do a 20 second break looking 20 feet away (+- 6 meters). 
It will also launch notifications with sound 10 seconds before the dialog comes out and once the 20 second break has passed.

Consider also blinking around 20 times during the 20 second break.
